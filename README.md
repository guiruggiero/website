# üöÄ Gui's digital Swiss Army knife

Welcome to the codebase powering my corner of the internet! This isn't your average personal website - it's a playground of utilities and AI-powered goodness that makes both my life and yours more interesting.

Star of the show? Meet GuiPT, my AI alter-ego. Think ChatGPT, but with a PhD in All Things Gui‚Ñ¢ and a better name. I'm probably biased there. Ask it anything about me, my work, or if I like tomatoes (spoiler: I don't).

The rest of the site is my professional highlight reel and a collection of utilities I built because it's fun and, well... why not make life easier?
